# ðŸ“Œ Task 6 â€“ Subqueries & Nested Queries

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The aim of this task is to **practice subqueries in SQL** by using them in:
- `SELECT` clause
- `WHERE` clause
- `FROM` clause

It also covers **scalar subqueries, correlated subqueries, EXISTS**, and **derived tables**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository
- **`task6.sql`** â€“ SQL script with:
  - Table creation & sample data
  - Multiple subquery examples
  - Usage of `EXISTS`, `IN`, scalar & correlated subqueries
---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench
- SQL (SQLite/MySQL syntax)

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts
- **Scalar Subquery** â€“ Returns a single value for each row in outer query.
- **Correlated Subquery** â€“ Refers to columns from the outer query.
- **EXISTS Clause** â€“ Checks if subquery returns any rows.
- **Derived Table** â€“ Subquery in the `FROM` clause.
- **Filtering with Subqueries** â€“ Dynamic filtering using results from subqueries.
